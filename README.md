Hello.
This is a project contributed to by Eddie Pritchard and Evan Gobien. Collectively, we are establishing an electronic synthesizer company.

Our project involves designing, prototyping, and manufacturing an 8-voice polyphonic euro rack standard synth that remains low cost.

Problem - Pure analog synths such as euro rack are expensive and have low functionality, cheaper alternatives with more functionality such as digital recreations of analog audio don't fully capture the pure raw sound you get from analog synths.

Our Solution - Designing a, fully analog, 8-voiced, euro rack compatible, low cost synth by optimizing space and circuit designs. Our designs are made for a wide variety of skill sets such as people who have never used modular synths before to industry professionals.

So far, we have built/are building the following components:

  - Low Noise 12 VAC to +/-12 VDC Power Supply
  - VCO


The following elements are currently in development:

  - VCA
